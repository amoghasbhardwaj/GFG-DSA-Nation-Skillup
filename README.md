# DSA Practice in Golang

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems implemented in **Golang**.  
The aim is to practice problem-solving skills, improve algorithmic thinking, and maintain a structured archive of solved problems with explanations and complexity analysis.

## Problems Solved

### Week 1
- **Closest Number** → Find the number closest to `n` that is divisible by `m`.
- **Floor and Ceil** → Find the floor and ceil values for a given number in a sorted array.
- **Odd or Even** → Determine whether a given number is odd or even.
- **Sum of Digits** → Calculate the sum of digits of a given number.
- **Sum of N Natural Numbers** → Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

### Week 2 - Arrays
- **Find Duplicates in Array** → Given an array of size `n` (elements in range `1` to `n`), find all numbers that appear twice.
- **Mean and Median of Array** → Given an array of integers, compute the mean and median (floor values).
- **Smallest and Second Smallest Element** → Find the smallest and second smallest elements in an array, or return `-1` if no second smallest exists.
